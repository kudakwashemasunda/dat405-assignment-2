Assignment 2: Data Visualisation 
https://github.com/kudakwashemasunda/dat405-assignment-2

For this assignment I was tasked with making a data visualisation project where I use data mines or APIs which their data will be shown on my website. For this assignment I decided to make a data visualisation based on maps. So once I had decided what I wanted to do to create my data visualisation project, I found an API key off google so that I would be able to link google and my website together to create the program.

Firstly, had to add the coordinates of the various cities in Europe that I wanted to include in my site and then used the API to tell me what time zones that the city was using at that current time. For me to have a diverse amount of options, I then added a dropdown selection box so that the user could easily switch between the different cities allowing user interaction. After coding, I tried to make the program the program to be more visually aesthetic for the users by adding a stylesheet so that the website can look more professional and polished for people who visit it. I also then added background images so that when a city is selected, the background image will change according to the choice of the user and will show on the background image highlighted to see where the city is located. 

After finishing the project, I did an analysis on the program and realised that if I would change anything on it, I would have wanted to be able to make it into a bigger map showing different continents and different cities but for reasons out of my control this wasnâ€™t possible as only coordinates for European countries would work and retrieve me any data so I had to settle for just European countries but I am still pleased on the outcome of my product.

Instructions on how to use the program are fairly simple and straight forward as I included the instruction on the page so that the user can never be confused when using the program. The program just asks the user to select the city that they like to know the time zone of and then the program responds by highlighting the city area in red and the time zone is then displayed on the screen as well if available.
